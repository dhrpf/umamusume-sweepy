# GOT RID OF RAINBOWS IN SCORING GO REDO UR PRESETS WE READING STAT GAINS DIRECTLY NOW


## Reinstall your device/emulator if you have used this bot before 22/1/2026
This is to get rid of residual traces of uiautomator2, likewise if your emulator has ever used anything that captures the screen without ADB direct screen capture it is recommended that you reinstall.     
(Likely uma wont even check for this but just to be safe)

# [GPU acceleration guide (click me later)](#gpu-setup)   

### Things this can do
- ✅ **Completely hands off**: Recover tp, Starting runs, finding the right guest cards.
  - **Everything is 100% automated you can just afk for **DAYS** until legacy umas are full**
  - **Handles everything from disconnections to the game crashing. The show will go on as long as there isn't a new update. (it handles that too now lol)**
  - **Supports background play as this runs on mobile emulators not the steam release. (You can play another game while this runs)**

- ✅ **Able to play every part of every Senario (As of writing this; URA and Unity)**
  - Is able to perform every action a human would take. From comparing skill hint levels to playing the claw machine and even deciding whether to conserve energy before summer or not. Everything you normally do this bot probably does it.

- ✅ **Supports every single uma and deckType**:
 -Every Aspect of training is customizable, If you're willing to spend time in the settings any playstyle becomes possible. For a quick overview please watch the video below as to what you can edit.      
  
(Video is outdated look at changelog or use the github search feature too check if something u want is there)

[demo.webm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40a5c402-d154-4b02-8a61-96ba07e29319)


### Emulator Setup

# DO NOT LOWER YOUR FPS BELOW 30

- **Only tested on bluestacks pie64 (no longer testing on bluestacks its too unreliable) and MuMuPlayer (what I use personally)**
- **Resolution**: 720 × 1280 (Portrait mode)
- **DPI**: 180
- **Graphics**: Standard (not Simple)
- **ADB**: Must be enabled in emulator settings

## 📦 Installation & Setup
Just cd into any folder and run 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SweepTosher/umamusume-sweepy
```

Then ensure python 3.10 is installed:

```bash
uninstall whatever python version you have

winget install -e --id Python.Python.3.10

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After that you can just:

```bash
python main.py
```
Or just run start.bat

if u can follow then heres a tutorial someone made (I didn't actually watch it lol): https://youtu.be/v1m9Plw7M3Y  

## ⚠️ Important Notes

As single run mode is deprecated if you wish to emulated it you can enable "Manual skill purchase at the end" to achieve the same thing 

### Game Settings

1. **Graphics**: Must be set to `Standard`, not `Basic`
2. **Training Setup**: **Manually select** Uma Musume, Legacy, and Support Cards in-game before starting
3. **Support Cards**: Avoid friend cards (no specific outing strategy)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting
- **Stuck in menu**: disable keep alive in background in emulator settings

#### Connection Problems

- **ADB connection fails**: Close accelerators, kill adb.exe, restart emulator

### STAT CAPS (People keep messing this up)
- Under normal circumstances you want to just put a large number into all of them like so this way it will always pick the best training option
  ![alt text](docs/statCaps.png)
- HOWEVER if you keep maxxing out a stat too early for example 1000+ speed before the 2nd summer you would want to do this
  ![alt text](docs/capSpeed.png)
- Stat caps work like this
 - Soft cap  
  When at 70,80,90% to stat goal -10 20 and 30% to score respectively  
 - Hard cap  
  95% or higher will now have 0 score (IF YOU SEE THIS THERE IS A ISSUE WITH YOUR DECK AND THE BOT WILL PERFORM POORLY)
 - IT IS ENCOURAGED THAT YOU RE-EVALUATE YOUR DECK INSTEAD. THIS WAY THE BOT CAN CLICK THE BEST OPTION 100% OF THE TIME INSTEAD OF ARTIFICIALLY LIMITING AND CLICKING A WORSE OPTION

## GPU Setup

This bot can optionally use an NVIDIA GPU to accelerate certain operations. Follow these steps:

1. Install drivers for your NVIDIA GPU.
2. Install **CUDA Toolkit 11.8**: [NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-8-0-download-archive)
3. Install **cuDNN v8.6.0 (October 3rd, 2022) for CUDA 11.x**

   * Download the ZIP folder from [NVIDIA cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-archive)
4. Extract the ZIP and move its contents to the respective CUDA folders for example:

   ```
   cudnn-windows-x86_64-8.6.0.163_cuda11-archive\cudnn-windows-x86_64-8.6.0.163_cuda11-archive\bin
   → C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\bin
   ```

   You are to do this for all the folders
   
5. Add the following three folders to your system **PATH**:

   * `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\bin`
   * `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\libnvvp`
   * `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8`
6. Copy this file:

   ```
   C:\Program Files\NVIDIA Corporation\Nsight Systems 2022.4.2\host-windows-x64\zlib.dll
   ```

   and paste it into:

   ```
   C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\bin
   ```

   Rename it to `zlibwapi.dll`.

7. Uninstall CPU version of PaddlePaddle:
```bash
pip uninstall paddlepaddle
```

8. Install GPU version of PaddlePaddle:
```bash
pip install paddlepaddle-gpu==2.6.2 -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
```

9. Update `requirements.txt` to prevent reinstalling CPU version:
```bash
Open requirements.txt and change line 71 from:
paddlepaddle==2.6.2

to:
paddlepaddle-gpu==2.6.2
```
Reboot

That should be all iirc if not go make a issue


Keep shilling this shit on /vg/ with the retarded forced meme ur making me look good
