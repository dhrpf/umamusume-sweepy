# **A automation tool for Uma Musume: Pretty Derby**

# [GPU acceleration guide (click me later)](#gpu-setup)    oh yeah good luck to AMD fuckers. not my problem lolol 
  


### Things this bot can do
- ✅ **Completely hands off**: Recover tp, Starting runs, finding the right guest card are all automated.
  - **Everything is 100% automated you can just afk for **DAYS** until legacy umas are full**
  - **Handles everything from disconnections to the game crashing. The show will go on as long as there isn't a new update. (it handles that too now lol)**
  - **Supports background play as this runs on mobile emulators not the steam release. (You can play another game while this runs)**

- ✅ **Able to play every part of every Senario (As of writing this; URA and Unity)**
  - Is able to perform every action a human would take. From comparing skill hint levels to playing the claw machine and even deciding whether to conserve energy before summer or not. Everything you normally do this bot probably does it.

- ✅ **Supports every single uma and deckType**:
 -Every Aspect of training is customizable, If you're willing to spend time in the settings any playstyle becomes possible. For a quick overview please watch the video below as to what you can edit.      
  
(Video is outdated look at changelog or use the github search feature too check if something u want is there)

## 🚨 Safety
Question: Is this safe?  

Answer: Safer than the steam release (All of your processes are transparent lmao), I have done what I can to humanize the inputs. **BUT** if they decide to put in the effort they **WILL** find you. It is near impossible to simulate perfect human behavior with code so use at your own risk. I take no responsibility.  **HIDING BEHIND A EMULATOR DOES NOT MAKE YOU UNDETECTABLE YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.** That being said it is still very difficult to detect as they have nothing to look at apart from metadata of your clicks. So you're likely fine  
Answer 2: As long as there are people cheating on the steam release we are chilling (if ykyk)  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel_species    

Running this 24/7 looks sus as hell so I would suggest turning it off for a few hours every day.  
you can edit the start and end time in `main.py` (24 hours format) to dictate when the bot can run)

### Emulator Setup

# DO NOT LOWER YOUR FPS BELOW 30

- **Only tested on bluestacks pie64 (no longer testing on bluestacks its too unreliable) and MuMuPlayer (what I use personally)**
- **Resolution**: 720 × 1280 (Portrait mode)
- **DPI**: 180
- **Graphics**: Standard (not Simple)
- **ADB**: Must be enabled in emulator settings

## 📦 Installation & Setup
Just cd into any folder and run 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SweepTosher/umamusume-sweepy
```

Then ensure python 3.10 is installed:

```bash
uninstall whatever python version you have

winget install -e --id Python.Python.3.10

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After that you can just:

```bash
python main.py
```
Or just run start.bat

if u can follow then heres a tutorial someone made (I didn't actually watch it lol): https://youtu.be/v1m9Plw7M3Y  

## ⚠️ Important Notes

As single run mode is deprecated if you wish to emulated it you can enable "Manual skill purchase at the end" to achieve the same thing 

### Game Settings

1. **Graphics**: Must be set to `Standard`, not `Basic`
2. **Training Setup**: **Manually select** Uma Musume, Legacy, and Support Cards in-game before starting
3. **Support Cards**: Avoid friend cards (no specific outing strategy)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting


#### Fan Goals Fail

- **Failed to the next goal races because lack of Fans**: Configure the race selection first in the UAT website to avoid lack of Fans

#### ADB Device Detection

- **No devices found**: Ensure emulator is running and ADB is enabled and open the umamusume app
- **ADB server issues**: The app automatically restarts ADB server if needed
- **Device not detected**: Check emulator's ADB settings

#### PowerShell Script Issues

- **Script crashes**: Open console first to see error messages
- **Execution policy**: Reference: [PowerShell Execution Policy](https://www.jianshu.com/p/4eaad2163567)

#### Connection Problems

- **ADB connection fails**: Close accelerators, kill adb.exe, restart emulator

## ⚠️ Known issues / Won’t fix
100% of my testing is now done on **MuMuplaye**r, **Loop until canceled execution mode** with **auto recover TP** set to true.  
I will only focus on fixing issues for those (which is what I use personally.) Everything else will be low priority sorry.

- Bot seems to get stuck sometimes
  - There are failsafes in place. It should break out of it within 5 minutes. If not then yeah I'll fix it.
- Detection of supports sometimes fails (you will know this if it keeps clicking wit training/a bad training and in the logs the score is either stuck/only detecting unknown cards)  
  - Just restart both the emulator and the bot.
  - If it works from the start then it should not break halfway (it either breaks 100% of the time since launch or it’s fine and will never break) so it’s not really an issue. I also have no idea what’s causing this.
- Sometimes it fails to detect the hint (!)  
  - It’s animated, so either I kill performance and template match like 20 screenshots or we just take the L when it fails to detect like 5% of the time
  - Could also check the general area for red pixels but it led to a bunch of false positives from my testing
- For most issues with outdated/wrong data  
  - https://github.com/BrayAlter/UAT-Global-Server/issues/63#issuecomment-3296260518 (you can stop at npx vite build btw it builds directly to the right folder now).  

### STAT CAPS (People keep messing this up)
- Under normal circumstances you want to just put a large number into all of them like so this way it will always pick the best training option
  ![alt text](docs/statCaps.png)
- HOWEVER if you keep maxxing out a stat too early for example 1000+ speed before the 2nd summer you would want to do this
  ![alt text](docs/capSpeed.png)
- Stat caps work like this
 - Soft cap  
  When at 70,80,90% to stat goal -10 20 and 30% to score respectively  
 - Hard cap  
  95% or higher will now have 0 score (IF YOU SEE THIS THERE IS A ISSUE WITH YOUR DECK AND THE BOT WILL PERFORM POORLY)
 - IT IS ENCOURAGED THAT YOU RE-EVALUATE YOUR DECK INSTEAD. THIS WAY THE BOT CAN CLICK THE BEST OPTION 100% OF THE TIME INSTEAD OF ARTIFICIALLY LIMITING AND CLICKING A WORSE OPTION

## GPU Setup

This bot can optionally use an NVIDIA GPU to accelerate certain operations. Follow these steps:

1. Install drivers for your NVIDIA GPU.
2. Install **CUDA Toolkit 11.8**: [NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-8-0-download-archive)
3. Install **cuDNN v8.6.0 (October 3rd, 2022) for CUDA 11.x**

   * Download the ZIP folder from [NVIDIA cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-archive)
4. Extract the ZIP and move its contents to the respective CUDA folders for example:

   ```
   cudnn-windows-x86_64-8.6.0.163_cuda11-archive\cudnn-windows-x86_64-8.6.0.163_cuda11-archive\bin
   → C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\bin
   ```

   You are to do this for all the folders
   
5. Add the following three folders to your system **PATH**:

   * `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\bin`
   * `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\libnvvp`
   * `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8`
6. Copy this file:

   ```
   C:\Program Files\NVIDIA Corporation\Nsight Systems 2022.4.2\host-windows-x64\zlib.dll
   ```

   and paste it into:

   ```
   C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\bin
   ```

   Rename it to `zlibwapi.dll`.

7. Uninstall CPU version of PaddlePaddle:
```bash
pip uninstall paddlepaddle
```

8. Install GPU version of PaddlePaddle:
```bash
pip install paddlepaddle-gpu==2.6.2 -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
```

9. Update `requirements.txt` to prevent reinstalling CPU version:
```bash
Open requirements.txt and change line 71 from:
paddlepaddle==2.6.2

to:
paddlepaddle-gpu==2.6.2
```
Reboot

That should be all iirc if not go make a issue


Keep shilling this shit on /vg/ with the retarded forced meme ur making me look good
